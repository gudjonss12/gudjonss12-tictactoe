## Student information:

Name: Guðjón Steinar Sverrisson
Age: 27

Background: I've been a student in computer science since the spring of 2015.
I've always been into video games and therefore i decided to study this field,
thinking it would be "easy", since i had spent so much time on the computer.
I cannot express how wrong i was about that, but I have had a great time in RU
so far, and hope I will continue to do so. The whole subject of this course is
very new to me, apart from what I learned earlier this semester in
Hugbúnaðafræði.

## What i hope to learn from this course:
I want to become confident in my understanding of the build pipeline.
Ideally, i want to be able to implement the strategies used in this course
for my own future projects and, if everything works out, show others the
benefits of developing software in this manner.
